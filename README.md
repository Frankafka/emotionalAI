Natural Language Understanding for Emotion Classification

# Project
The goal of this project is to develop a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithm for classifying the underlying emotion associated with a chat message so that chatbots and other programs can use this information to deliver a better experience to users.

# Background
People have goals. Some goals are explicit and others are implicit. Explicit goals are usually easy to identify because a person can clearly articulate them, like buying groceries, resolving a billing issue, traveling to the beach, updating a software, etc. Implicit goals, on the other hand, are more difficult to identify. These are emotional goals that aren't always articulated even though the achievement of these emotional goals are often more valuable than the explicit goals. Not only does a person want to buy groceries, they also want to feel good about the experience.

Many NLU pipelines have been designed and refined to determine explicit goals.  For example, intent and entity extaction is used to determine a person's explicit goal within a specific context.  But there hasn't been a lot of work to determine implicit goals to determine their current emotional state and guide them to a positive emotional state by the end of an interaction.

It requires emotional intelligence to accurately recognize emotions. As we all know from customer service interactions, not all people have this level of emotional intelligence. If a program can automate this emotional classification process, then organizations could use this information to dramatically improve a wide variety of service encounters acorss industries.

# Use Case
The specific application of this classification algorithm will be for the NLU pipeline of an emotionally intelligence chatbot.  The algorithm classifies the general emotion associated with the message and then identifies the approproate custom emoji that represents that emotion.  You can demo the algorith here.
