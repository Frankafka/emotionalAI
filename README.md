Natural Language Understanding for Emotional Classification of Messages

# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithm for classifying the underlying emotion associated with a chat message so that chatbots and other programs can use this information to deliver a better experience to users.

People have goals. Some goals are explicit and others are implicit. Explicit goals are usually easy to identify because a person can clearly articulate them, like buying groceries, resolving a billing issue, traveling to the beach, updating a software, etc. Implicit goals, on the other hand, are more difficult to identify. These are emotional goals that aren't always articulated even though the achievement of these emotional goals are often more valuable than the explicit goals. Not only does a person want to buy groceries, they also want to feel good about the experience.

It requires emotional intelligence to recognize emotions and act in ways that will address these emotions in a healthy and harmonious way. As we all know from customer service interactions, not all people have this level of emotional intelligence. If a program can automate this emotional classification process, then organizations could use this information to dramatically improve a wide variety of service encounters acorss industries.
